    <h2 id="why-unity-in-bible-reading">Why Unity In Bible Reading?</h2>
    <p>The primary goal is to encourage more Christians to read the entire Bible. There is power in unity, joining together in reading the Bible will present a great opportunity for growth in our faith. It will keep us accountable, encourage us to continue, and foster conversation centered around His word.</p>
    <h2 id="how-it-was-made">How It Was Made</h2>
    <p>When creating a reading plan the toughest decision is deciding how to divide the reading. This reading plan strives to create consistency in how much you read from day to day. The first attempt in creating this plan was to count all the words of the Bible, divide the words by the number of days in a year, then round to the nearest chapter. This provided some level of consistency but could be improved by including headings as dividing points. The next question was, “Which headings should be included?” Each Bible translation has its own set of headings. In order to remove bias, six prominent translations were chosen: CSB, ESV, NASB, NIV, NKJV, and NLT. For the New Testament, a heading was only included if at least 4 of the 6 translations had a heading at that verse. The Old Testament has far fewer headings per word count and less agreement on the location of the headings. For that reason, an Old Testament heading was included if at least 3 of the 6 translations had a heading at that verse.</p>
    <p>The final plan is this: the average word count of all 6 translations divided by 365, rounded to the nearest heading and/or chapter.</p>
    <h2 id="why-canonical-order">Why Canonical Order?</h2>
    <p>The books of the Bible differ in authorship, historical context, and literary style. It is easier to understand the context when reading one book at a time rather than several at a time.</p>
    <p>Most Bibles are in canonical order, therefore, it is easier for people to read in this order.</p>
