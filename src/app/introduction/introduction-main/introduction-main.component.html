    <h2 id="why-unity-in-bible-reading">Unity In Bible Reading</h2>
    <p>This plan provides a consistent reading experience for reading the entire Bible in one year. Other canonical Bible reading plans are divided by chapters. Some chapters are very long, while others are very short. Dividing the reading this way will lead to inconsistencies in how much you read each day. We have designed a more consistent reading experience.</p>
    <h2 id="how-it-was-made">How It Was Made</h2>
    <p>We calculated the average word count of every verse across the six most prominent English translations: CSB, ESV, NASB, NIV, NKJV, and NLT. We took the average word count of the entire Bible, divided it by the total number of days in the year (365), then rounded to the nearest <i>possible heading</i>* and/or chapter. Depending on your translation, the reading might not end at a heading or chapter. Please keep in mind that it does end at a heading for other translations.</p>
    <p>*<i>possible heading</i><br>Headings do not exist in the original books of the Bible but were added by English translators. A heading may exist in one translation but not another. In order to remove bias, we did not include every heading of all six translations as possible dividing points. For the New Testament, a heading was only chosen as a possible dividing point if it existed at the same verse for at least four of the six translations. Since the Old Testament (OT) has fewer headings per word count, and less agreement on the location of the headings, an OT heading was included if at least three of the six translations had a heading at that verse.</p>
    <h2 id="why-canonical-order">Why Canonical Order?</h2>
    <p>The Bible is a collection of books. Canonical order refers to the present-day order of those books. We believe, just as the books of the Bible are divinely inspired, so too is the order. Reading the Bible in its present order empowers us to learn in a way that is not possible when jumping between books. The books of the Bible differ in authorship, historical context, and literary style. It is easier to understand the context when reading through one book at a time.</p>
    <h2 id="encouragement-for-first-time-readers">Encouragement for First Time Readers</h2>
    <p>We all know in part (1 Corinthians 13:9-12) and are not called to, nor able to, fully understand all Scripture. One thing that discourages first time readers from reading the entire Bible is attempting to understand it all. Each daily reading should be about 11 minutes. When there is a passage you don't understand, it is great to seek the Lord for understanding but you must move on if you don't have time. Remember, Holy Spirit is your teacher (John 14:26). It’s ok if there are days you don’t feel like you learned anything. Not even the disciples understood everything Jesus had spoken but Holy Spirit brings things to remembrance (John 14:26). Like the disciples there will be times where you will understand later (John 2:21-22).</p>
